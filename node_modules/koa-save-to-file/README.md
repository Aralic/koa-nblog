# Koa Save To File [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanong/koa-save-to-file.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanong/koa-save-to-file)

Save a stream to a file.
Useful when clients upload files (ie images) directly (not using multipart),
or when you want to save each file in a multipart stream on a case-by-case basis.

## Example

```js
app.use(function (next) {
  return function* () {
    yield this.saveToFile(require('os').tmpdir() + '/image.png')
    next()
  }
})
```

## API

```js
app.context(require('koa-save-to-file'))
```

### this.saveToFile([stream], destination [, options])

- `stream` - if not defined, uses `this.req`.
- `destination` - a string specifying where you want to save the file to.
- `options`
  - `limit` - the file limit. Overrides `this.limit`.
  - `expected` - expected file size, will throw if it does not match up. `content-length` by default.

returns `destination`
